# Digital Game-Based Learning Dataset
This repository contains the toolkit developed and anonymised dataset collected for _**“Evaluating the effectiveness of digital game-based learning (DGBL) for professional upskilling: Bringing construction safety knowledge into architects' and engineers' workplace”**_ project. The data is intended to support further analysis  and research in the field of educational technologies and DGBL approaches for professional development. 

**Principal investigator:** A/P Goh Yang Miang

**Project Team:** Dr Juliana Tay, Ms Sufiana Safiena, Dr Michelle Lim, Mr Lan Tianxiang

## Project Information
This project was conducted in the context of teaching Design for Safety (DfS) skills to construction industry professionals. The game developed in this project is SafeSim Design (SSD), a single-player computer game, featuring four scenarios in a simulated construction site.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following components:

- **Legend:** This provided the descriptions of the variables within the dataset, explaining the purpose and nature of each item.
- **Combined dataset:** This is the main dataset, which consolidated all information collected from various instruments. This includes participant data, survey responses, and quiz scores.
- **Game dataset:** This included the data specific to the participants' experience and interactions within SafeSim Design (SSD).
- **Forum:** This data is related to the peer discussions (i.e., alternative solutions provided for the design risk within SSD) provided by the participants.

## Usage
You can access each sheet individually for your analysis. The legend sheet should be referred to in order to understand the variables and their meanings before proceeding with any analysis. 

The dataset is suitable for quantitative analysis, such as statistical modelling or machine learning. It can be used to explore relationships between various educational approaches, including the effectiveness of DGBL.
